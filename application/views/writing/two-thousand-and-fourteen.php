    <h2>Two Thousand and Fourteen</h2>
    <h4 class="date">Posted: <date>31st December 2014</date></h4>

    <p>It's been a very exciting year, I've visited <strong>six countries</strong> and biked across the border into a seventh. I've enjoyed many happy memories with friends and family :)</p>

                <h4>Birthday in Amsterdam</h4>
                <p>Talked about, but not organised. At the last minute I booked a weekend trip to Amsterdam for my 21<sup>st</sup> birthday.</p>

    <p>Towards the end of January I took a day trip down to London with my friend Ed, the weather was pretty grim, but we went on a twilight tour of the Tower of London which was great!</p>

                <h4>Scotland Skiing and Walking</h4>
                <p>I spent a week in the Scottish Highlands with my mother and sisters, we skied on some lovely snow, and walked seeing some lovely views.</p>

    <p>On the <strong>16<sup>th</sup> March</strong> I set out into the peak district with my brother Steve, and Ed to make a mountain bike film, we learnt a lot about continuity, and after looking through all of the footage, I managed to edit it all together and get it uploaded before going to bed.</p>

    <p>After having a few too many drinks in the recently opened Brew Dog in Sheffield my friends had to carry me home, marking yet another drunken tale to be told on nights out.</p>

                <h4>Biking in Wales</h4>
                <p>I was once again enjoying mountain biking, spending a weekend in Wales; Saturday at Bike Park Wales and Sunday at the Forest of Dean.</p>

    <p>I got up in the middle of the night and with my dad we went to take some photos of the sunrise up on Curbar Edge, I <a href="https://photos.joelvardy.com/79db81d451b1841f65a9665332ba34db" title="Curbar Edge Cows" data-analytics="Joels Photos">captured this amazing photo</a>.</p>

    <p>The month of May also brought the <strong>Steel City DH</strong> race at Grenoside woods. My first time back at the woods since my crash there last year. I captured a <a href="https://photos.joelvardy.com/4c2add6930c8551c617230875f5b5940" title="Steve Peat" data-analytics="Joels Photos">fantastic photo of Steve Peat</a>.</p>

    <p>With wonderful bright, warm days I found myself spending a lot of time outside, either on my bike with friends, or taking photos.</p>

    <p>Mid <strong>August</strong> I packed up my bike and lugged it to the oversized baggage desk at Luton airport. Arriving in the alps we were confronted with torrential rain for hours.. It didn't really inspire me to get out into the mud. But the next day we gave it a shot.</p>
    <p>There was mud, but I've ridden in worse, I had a great time riding with some awesome people, have a look at <a href="https://trail.sx/f12d70" title="Alps biking tracks" data-analytics="Trails">where I rode my bike</a>.</p>

    <p>I have been anticipating an Apple iMac which has a retina screen, so I ordered the new 5K iMac as soon as it was release, I quickly set on <a href="/writing/carbon-workspace" title="Carbon Workspace">updating my workspace</a> for the new hardware.</p>

    <p>On bonfire night myself and two friends saw a great firework display at Waltham Windmill, the following weekend we had an enjoyable family bonfire, which as usual was pretty big, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsbGcxAxhdI" title="2014 Bonfire Timelpase" data-analytics="Bonfire Timelapse on YouTube">take a look at the timelapse</a>.</p>

    <p>I also saw A Day to Remember in Leeds with my good friend Andrew. And was visited by four <s>evil</s> great Scottish spirits which resulted in a great night drinking.</p>

                <h4>Snow on Boxing Day</h4>
                <p>In Sheffield we actually enjoyed some nice snow just after Christmas, and the cold weather meant the snow hung around for several days.</p>

    <p>I've spent a lot of this summer taking photos, I've seen an improvement in the quality of the photos I've taken but I still have a lot to learn. I'm hoping to progress even more in 2015 and hopefully develop some more powerful timelapse techniques.</p>
