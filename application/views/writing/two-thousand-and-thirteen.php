	<h2>Two Thousand and Thirteen</h2>
	<h4>Posted: <date>1st January 2014</date></h4>

	<p>I've done so much in two thousand and thirteen; <strong>good</strong>, <strong>bad</strong>, <strong>sad</strong>, <strong>happy</strong>, <strong>important</strong>, and <strong>trivial</strong>. I'm going to keep a record of these things here, hopefully I'll look back at the list when I'm a little more decrepit.</p>

	<p>I started the year off, as I usually do, with my birthday, a very chilled out evening with some friends.</p>

				<h5>Bought a MacBook Pro</h5>
				<p>I was working at <a href="/projects#2k-drive" title="2K Drive">Lucid Games</a> where I was provided a Mac Mini and an iPad, I enjoyed using the Mac so much I decided to join the darkside.</p>
