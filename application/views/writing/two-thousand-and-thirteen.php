	<h2>Two Thousand and Thirteen</h2>
	<h4>Posted: <date>1st January 2014</date></h4>

	<p>I've done so much in two thousand and thirteen; <strong>good</strong>, <strong>bad</strong>, <strong>sad</strong>, <strong>happy</strong>, <strong>important</strong>, and <strong>trivial</strong>. I'm going to keep a record of these things here, hopefully I'll look back at the list when I'm a little more decrepit.</p>

	<p>I started the year off, as I usually do, with my birthday, a very chilled out evening with some friends.</p>

				<h4>Bought a MacBook Pro</h4>
				<p>I was working at <a href="/projects#2k-drive" title="2K Drive">Lucid Games</a> where I was provided a Mac Mini and an iPad, I enjoyed using the Mac so much I decided to join the dark side.</p>

	<p>I treated myself to a new GoPro, with the hope that I would finally capture some awesome skiing / biking shots.</p>

	<p>I attended the second Summit Awesome hackathon in Manchester, and while still high on energy drink put together <a href="https://vimeo.com/joelvardy/sa-hack-man-2013" title="Manchester hackathon time-lapse" data-analytics="Manchester hackathon timelapse on Vimeo">this time-lapse</a> using my new GoPro.</p>

	<p>Straight after the 24 hour hackathon in Manchester I traveled directly to Aviemore in the Scottish Highlands, I was exhausted when I arrived, but the beautiful weather made up for it. <strong>I even got out on my snowboard!</strong>.</p>

				<h4>Enjoyed the Awesome Scottish Snow</h4>
				<p>It was hard to choose the photo for this event, because I took so many great photos while I was up in Scotland for a week in February.</p>

	</div>

	<p>I've wanted a dSLR which can record video for years, in 2012 I borrowed a good friends Canon 5D mk2, and in April I decided to buy my own.</p>

	<p>I also went up to Scotland for a long weekend with my mum in March. After a day skiing at the Nevis Range we saw the wind would be too high for skiing the next day so we did an ice climbing taster session at Ice Factor at Kinlochleven.</p>

				<h4>Attended First Conference</h4>
				<p>I was very happy to attend Industry Conf in Newcastle.</p>

	<p>After refusing to use a music streaming service for so long, in April I finally gave in and started using Spotify, I haven't looked back since!</p>

	<p>I visited Oxford for a day with a few friends, it was a beautiful sunny day. However I'm still quite surprised that with four guys <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(boat)" title="What is punting?">punting</a> on the river Cherwell, one of us didn't end up in the water. We also watched Derren Brown's svengali show, however I felt this was pretty disappointing.</p>

				<h4>Berlin</h4>
				<p>I visited Berlin twice in 2013, the first time was in May, the second, in August.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>I took time out from work, to cycle over to Derwent reservoir and witness a Lancaster bomber perform a flypast.</p>

	<p>The weather was very nice from the end of May into the start of June, so I was out on my bike a lot, visiting the Derwent reservoir for a second time, Farmer Johns, and Style Cop within a week.</p>

	<p>I attended a Summit Awesome event in Leeds, at which I (as usual) got heavily inebriated, while <a href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/994293_10151508302973458_1397096882_n.jpg" title="Photo from Facebook">taking lots of photos</a>.</p>

	<p>Myself and a friend took part in a climbing introduction course at a local climbing wall, during the warm summer I started doing some bouldering out in Derbyshire with another friend.</p>

				<h4>Of Tales Untold</h4>
				<p>I went to a mini festival called <strong>Of Tales Untold</strong> in Nottinghamshire. Where my brother and some friends did some fire poi.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>I saw Fall Out Boy in Hamburg, I have been a fan for years, and was so happy when I heard they they were ending their hiatus late 2012, it was awesome to finally see them live!</p>

				<p>Me, my mum, and my sisters spent a week up in the Orkney Islands.</p>

	<p>While in Germany, I planned to go to Leeds Fest, the first <strong>real</strong> festival I've been to. The mud was horrific, the bands were great, lugging our stuff back across the ruined fields to the bus was a struggle. But my highlight by far (as all of my friends know) was seeing Eminem perform live!</p>

				<p>Me and my brother enjoyed shooting in Prague, and mountain biking in &Scaron;pindler&#367;v Ml&yacute;n.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>I was really enjoying mountain biking, even more so because I now had a GoPro and a great quality dSLR to document our adventures. Me and my brother were riding a local mini downhill track several times a week while the weather was nice.</p>

				<h4>MTB Crash</h4>
				<p>The annual trail maintenance had finished in Grenoside woods, the trails were great, but unfortunately the day ended with me in A and E.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>This year I was introduced to Farmer Johns, a well maintained mountain bike park in Stockport. A week after my mountain bike crash I spectated a night race at Farmer Johns, it was great to get back out of the house and see some biking.</p>

	<p>When I got my new bike in July I decided to start using Strava, in the six months I was using Strava, I recorded 32 rides covering over <strong>650km</strong>. My favourite decent this year is Jacob's Ladder having ridden it three times in 2013.</p>

	<p>I love getting something to build on Christmas day, this year I received a Lego Technic service truck, I created a time-lapse of the <a href="https://vimeo.com/joelvardy/lego-service-truck" title="Lego service truck time-lapse">build process</a>.</p>

	<p>On a programming front, 2013 saw me start using Composer for package management in PHP, and node.js for running server side JavaScript. I'm hoping to increasingly use node.js in 2014.</p>
