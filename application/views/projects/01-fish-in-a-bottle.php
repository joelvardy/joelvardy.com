		<p>I relocated to Leamington Spa to work for Fish in a Bottle where I was involved in developing a social network called IGGY, a website which is aimed at gifted 13 to 19 year olds, the website gives them a place to discuss and debate with intellectual peers, gain guidance from university student mentors, and participate in projects and competitions.</p>
		<p>Myself and two other developers saw the project through from planning to conclusion.</p>
