		<p>Working with the in house designer I first created a static website, the design was quite simple although I had to use image replacement for some text, and I build a jQuery plugin to display a scrolling set of words at the top of the page.</p>
		<p>Several months later I was asked to create a content management system for the website, I built this using CodeIgniter and the Ion Auth library for authentication, the CMS is quite basic but allows the company to manage news and work posts.</p>
