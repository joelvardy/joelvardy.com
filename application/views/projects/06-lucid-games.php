		<p>While at Lucid Games in Liverpool I worked on an iOS game which primarily involved writing object oriented javascript, however I was for some part also working developing the server API, to which the javascript and game communicated.</p>
		<p>The javascript did make use of jQuery for animations, and selectors, however there was a substantial amount of of vanilla OOJS, and CSS3.</p>
