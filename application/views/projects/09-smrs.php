		<p>SMRS is an advertising recruitment agency, for me this meant building websites which informed the user about a company they may be interested in applying for.</p>
		<p>My role at SMRS meant I was involved in planning, development, deployment, and maintenance for a range of web projects including some large names such as easyJet, Thomas Cook, and The Co-operative Bank. I was also mentoring a junior front end developer who will be an asset to the company in future web projects.</p>
