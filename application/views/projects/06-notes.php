		<p>I wanted to reinforce my objective oriented JavaScript knowledge and use Laravel 4, so I built a web app which allows you to take notes. I made this a little more unique by adding client side encryption to the notes.</p>
		<p>I made the site responsive using media queries, and made use of SVGs to ensure it was retina friendly.</p>
