		<p>My time at Lucid Games was spent working on a multiplayer iOS racing game.</p>
		<p>Initially I was working on writing and maintaining object oriented JavaScript which is used in most of the game interfaces. I learnt a lot doing this and it has lead on to me writing my own JavaScript / node.js applications.</p>
		<p>As time went on I took up a consultant role focused on the server side, I was working on stability, and implementing new API features.</p>
