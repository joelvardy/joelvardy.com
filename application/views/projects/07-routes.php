		<p>I developed a simple routing library which allows you write RESTful routes and map them to an anonymous function.</p>
		<p>I have used this on several projects and decided to <a href="https://github.com/joelvardy/routes" title="RESTful routes repository" data-analytics="RESTful routes repo">open source</a> the code and add it to <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/joelvardy/routes" title="RESTful routes package" data-analytics="RESTful routes package">Packagist</a>.</p>
