		<p>While at Fish in a Bottle in Leamington Spa I worked on a project called IGGY, a website which is aimed at gifted 13 to 19 year olds, the website gives them a place to learn from academics and partake in challenges.</p>
		<p>Myself and two other developers saw the project through from planning to conclusion.</p>
