			<li><strong>Project Type:</strong> Side Project</li>
			<li><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="http://highland-webcams.com" title="Highland Webcams" data-analytics="Highland Webcams">highland-webcams.com</a></li>

		<p>There are several live webcam feeds from which a still is taken and archived, this archive can then be accessed by users through the website.</p>
		<p>Some of the challenges I faced with this project are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Archiving according to a unique schedule for each feed, some update every minute, 24 hours a day, some only for a few hours each day.</li>
			<li>Handling slow downloads.</li>
			<li>Unreliable webcam feeds, resulting in either images not being updated, or being corrupted.</li>
			<li>Having to be as efficient as possible, and ensuring the archive is fast.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The archive has <strong>several million</strong> images archived, which is around 200GB stored on Amazon S3 (distributed through Cloud Front.)</p>
		<p>This has been a side project I've been maintaining and updating for several years, over that time there have been <a href="http://highland-webcams.com/about" title="About Highland Webcams" data-analytics="Highland Webcams">many iterations</a>. Most recently I rebuilt the website using <strong>Lumen by Laravel</strong> as I wanted to test the framework out.</p>
