		<p>My time at Lucid Games was spent working on a multiplayer iOS racing game called 2K Drive.</p>
		<p>Initially I was working on writing and maintaining object oriented JavaScript which is used in most of the game interfaces. I learnt a lot working in a JavaScript codebase this large, and doing so lead me to writing my own JavaScript / node.js applications.</p>
		<p>As time went on I took up a consultant role focused on the server side code, I was working on stability, and implementing new API features for the game.</p>
