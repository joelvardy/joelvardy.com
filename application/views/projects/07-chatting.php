		<p>As one of the first things I built with node.js I kept it simple, but added a twist to the standard "messaging system" by encrypting all messages locally in the users browser. The encryption key is stored in the URL so by sharing the URL with friends you can securely send messages.</p>
		<p>If you would like to see how I have built the website, please review the <a href="https://github.com/joelvardy/chatting.im" title="Open source repository" data-analytics="chatting.im repo">the source code</a> on GitHub.</p>
