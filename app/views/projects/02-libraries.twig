        <h2>Libraries</h2>

        <p>Of course I have written many libraries being a developer, a few of them I thought were universal enough to be useful for other developers.</p>

        <p>I've also put some small utility libraries on <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/joelvardy" title="Composer libraries on Packagist" data-analytics="Composer libraries on Packagist">Packagist</a>.</p>

        <h4>CodeIgniter Authentication Library</h4>

        <p>I had built a few very simple projects using CodeIgniter when I decided to create my own authentication library, where full blown access control lists aren't required, or where you want the authentication library to use an existing users table. It is well commented, and uses a very secure hashing algorithm. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/joelvardy/Basic-CodeIgniter-Authentication" title="Open source repository" data-analytics="CodeIgniter Authentication repo">GitHub</a> for the source code.</p>

        <h4>Authentication Library</h4>

        <p>A year after developing the CodeIgniter authentication library, I re-wrote it as a Composer package which would be framework agnostic, feel free to view <a href="https://github.com/joelvardy/authentication" title="Open source repository" data-analytics="Authentication repo">the source code</a>.</p>

        <h4>RESTful Routing</h4>

        <p>a simple routing library which allows you to write RESTful perfect for APIs - I have used this on several projects (including on this website) and decided to <a href="https://github.com/joelvardy/routes" title="RESTful routes repository" data-analytics="RESTful routes repo">open source</a> the code and add it to <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/joelvardy/routes" title="RESTful routes package" data-analytics="RESTful routes package">Packagist</a>.</p>
