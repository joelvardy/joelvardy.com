        Tunneling your network traffic through an SSH connection can be useful if you want to encrypt all outbound traffic, get around a
        corporate firewall, or make connections from a white listed static IP address.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way I had previously done this was to run a command in the terminal to open up a SOCKS proxy, then change the Google Chrome
        network settings to route all requests through the tunnel. However I am going to show you how I have SSH tunnels set up on my Mac.

        After trying several utilities which had terrible UIs, or lacking features, I found
        <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ssh-proxy/id597790822" title="SSH Proxy on the Mac app store">SSH Proxy</a>. While it will
        set you back &pound;1.49 I think after you've seen how easy it makes opening SSH tunnels, you will agree that is a small price to
        pay!
      </p>
      <p>Once you've installed the SSH Proxy utility, go to preferences and ensure</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Listening port</strong> is set to 7070 <strong>Turn on proxy when started</strong> checkbox is ticked.
        <strong>Launch when logged in</strong> checkbox is ticked.

      <p>
        Then add a server under the <strong>Servers</strong> tab, simply setting the details to login to the server over SSH. You can then
        close the preferences window. Select <strong>Turn proxy on</strong> from the utility menu in the status bar.

      <p>
        The next step is to make the operating system (OSX) use the SOCKS proxy for all network connections, do do this navigate to:
        <strong>System Preferences</strong> > <strong>Network</strong> > <strong>Advanced</strong> > <strong>Proxies</strong> >
        <strong>SOCKS Proxy</strong>. Then set the host to 127.0.0.1 and the port to 7070, as shown below:

      <h3 id="workflow">Workflow</h3>
      <p>
        The SSH Proxy app has an option called
        <strong>Direct internet connection (no proxy)</strong> this is very useful because it means so long as the utility is running you
        can use no proxy, or route all network traffic through a proxy, without having to do anything but two clicks.
      </p>
      <h3 id="etchosts">/etc/hosts</h3>
      <p>
        When your traffic is being tunneled through a SSH tunnel your hosts file will not be used to resolve hostnames. If you are doing
        local development you will want to add exceptions to the network proxies preferences, see
        <a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/95198" title="Read more at StackExchange">this answer on StackExchange</a>. If you have a
        better solution to this, please get in touch.
