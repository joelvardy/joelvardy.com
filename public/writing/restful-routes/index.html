        A Composer package which allows you to easily map routes to a block of code. This is an ideal base for small websites and RESTful
        APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Update:</strong> this is not a perfect library, you may want to consider using the
        <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/" title="a micro framework for PHP">Slim micro framework</a>, which is usually what I now find
        myself using.
      </p>
      <h3 id="requiringthepackage">Requiring the Package</h3>
      <p>
        I'm not going to explain how to use composer, if you are not sure then
        <a href="http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md" title="Getting started with Composer">read the manual</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Open your <code class="language-markup">composer.json</code> file and require the routes package.</p>
      <pre><code class="markup language-markup">"require": {
    "joelvardy/routes": "v1.1"
}</code></pre>
      <p>Then ensure you run the composer update command.</p>
      <h3 id="instantiatingthelibrary">Instantiating the Library</h3>
      <p>
        Ensure you have the composer autoloading setup, then you just need to instantiate the library by adding
        <code class="language-php">$routes = new Joelvardy\Routes();</code> - at this point your file should look something like:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="php language-php">// Autoload Composer
require('vendor/autoload.php');

// Instantiate routes library
$routes = new Joelvardy\Routes();

echo 'Hello Routes!';</code></pre>
      <h3 id="addingaroute">Adding a Route</h3>
      <p>
        Now we are going to add a route to create a new user account, because we are creating something we will <strong>POST</strong> to our
        API endpoint.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="php language-php">$routes-&gt;post('/user', function () {
    // Add the user to the database
    $user-&gt;create($_POST['username'], $_POST['password'], $_POST['email']);
});</code></pre>
      <p>
        As you might imagine you can use a different REST method by substituting
        <code class="language-php">$routes->post(</code> with any of the accepted methods: <strong>GET</strong>, <strong>POST</strong>,
        <strong>PUT</strong>, <strong>PATCH</strong>, and <strong>DELETE</strong>.
      </p>
      <h3 id="regularexpressions">Regular Expressions</h3>
      <p>
        You will generally have dynamic routes for example, the URI in your browser at the moment ends
        <strong>/writing/restful-routes</strong> usually you will want to grab that <em>slug</em> and read an item from your database which
        is associated with it.
      </p>
      <p>You can do this using regular expressions, for example:</p>
      <pre><code class="php language-php">$routes-&gt;get('/user/([a-zA-Z0-9-_]+)', function ($username) {
    // Check the username exists
    if ( ! $users-&gt;read_by_username($username)) return false;
    echo 'Read specific user, username: '.$username;
});</code></pre>
      <h3 id="custom404error">Custom 404 Error</h3>
      <p>
        In the above example you can see we check whether the user exists, and if not we return false. Returning false from the anonymous
        function will cause a 404 error to be returned.
      </p>
      <p>We can add a special route which is run if no routes are matched, or if a matching route returns false.</p>
      <pre><code class="php language-php">$routes-&gt;notFound(function () {
    echo 'Error 404 :(';
});</code></pre>
      <h3 id="runningtheroutes">Running the Routes</h3>
      <p>
        After adding the routes you must run
        <code class="language-php">$routes->run();</code> this is easily forgotten, but without it none of the routes will run.
      </p>
      <h3 id="useit">Use It!</h3>
      <p>
        So, there you have it, you can view the Composer package on
        <a
          href="https://packagist.org/packages/joelvardy/routes"
          title=' title="RESTful routes package" data-analytics="RESTful routes package">Packagist</a> - or you can look at the code on [RESTful routes repository](https://github.com/joelvardy/routes "RESTful routes repository on GitHub'
          >GitHub</a
        >
        which has a complete usage example.
