            <p>Today I knew no one would be home, I wasn't waiting for any deliveries, and I wanted to put together a simple mobile app. So I decided I would take a timelapse of me working.</p>
            <p>I've always liked workspaces, I enjoy looking at other peoples workspace, the tools they use, and digging into their work flow. If you're just as curious feel free to have a look at <a href="/workspace" title="Joel Vardy's Workspace">my workspace</a>.</p>
            <h3 id="theproject">The Project</h3>
            <p>I wanted to build a mobile (Android) app which would allow you to roll a die (or two dice) but all of the apps I tried looked like crap, required an internet connection, or had ads.</p>
            <p>Now even if the dice are missing, you can play Monopoly in the middle of nowhere. <s>Download it from Google Play now.</s></p>
            <div class="video aspect-16-9">
                <iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/101806233?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <h3 id="youreallyliketimelapse">You Really Like Timelapse'</h3>
            <p>I think this is because they are pretty easy to accomplish, you set up a camera, then leave it alone. Post processing is a breeze compared to wading though loads of footage and putting it together in a meaningful way.</p>
            <p>I've found it's much easier to use my GoPro to take timelapse' rather then a dSLR. And it's certainly easier to mount the GoPro, for the above timelapse I mounted it on underside of my bed to achieve a birds-eye view of my development work.</p>
            <p>I also recorded the screen using Screenflick (at one frame a second) - however the app reported it would take 12 hours to export the video <em>sigh</em> - so I haven't added that video in the corner of this one as I had planned. Maybe next time.</p>
