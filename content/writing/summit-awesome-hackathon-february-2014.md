Almost a year on from the last Summit Awesome hackathon, we are back in Manchester, at the TechHub, for another two day hackathon with some great, like-minded people.

There have been two Summit Awesome hackathons previous to this one, after both I think everyone has been in agreement that doing an all nighter is a pretty stupid idea. But did I book into a local hotel room, of course not. Did I bring my amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/joelvardy/status/381031947029340160" data-analytics="MusucBag tweet">MusucBag</a>, no I didn't.

### The Projects
There were several projects being worked on between the 25 people, the ones I remember:

 * **CMYK**: Real-time design feedback, <a href="http://cmyk.im" data-analytics="CMYK app">cmyk.im</a>.
 * **XinPet**: Managing pets microchips.
 * **Chekk.it**: Find the status of Minecraft plugins.

No wanting to commit time to a new projects, I was working on finishing one of my own existing personal projects.

### Timelapse
I really love timelapses, I set one up last year, and it was really well accepted, so I did one again this year.

When I was trying to make the edit more interesting, I realised I should have taken some clips of people typing away ect.. But hey, I'm still learning and trying new things.

### The Burnout
I can't actually remember the last time I did an all nighter, so by 4am I was really feeling the lack of sleep. With almost everyone else asleep, I looked at what time the next train to Sheffield was, this set the seed of an idea, and I did decide to get the first train back home in the morning.

This meant I unfortunately missed the presentations on Sunday afternoon, but I have to say my bed has never been so comfy!

### Next Time
I really hope next time the days are forcibly spilt up, it would be additional cost for people who don't want to pay for somewhere to stay, but I think everyone would be more awake (and actually in attendance) on the Sunday.

I really recommend attending a Summit Awesome meet up, either for food, drinks, or a hackathon. Find out more at <a href="http://summitawesome.co.uk/" title="Summit Awesome" data-analytics="Summit Awesome">summitawesome.co.uk</a>.
