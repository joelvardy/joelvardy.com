My workspace has been updated several times since it was featured on Lifehacker, after my summer trip to Iceland I put some A2 prints up on the walls, they look great, but the surface of my desk was looking worn, it was time for an update.

 * Filling in the cut out, giving me more leg room.
 * Adding a vinyl covering to the surface of the desk.
 * Switching custom built NAS for a LaCie 10TB drive.
 * Setting up my new Retina 5K iMac.

When fitting the vinyl covering, which is carbon fibre effect, I was worried this was going to look extremely *tacky*, however when it's being used I think it looks nice, it breaks up what was a sterile white area.

### The Hardware
**AirPort Extreme**, this can be seen on the far right of the desk, it's broadcasting on 2.4GHz and 5GHz.

**Storage**, I've moved from a custom built NAS, to a 10TB LaCie 5big drive which connects using Thunderbolt 2, this means I can browse photos straight from my storage device, something which was terribly slow with my NAS.

**Nexus Wireless Charger**, this is such a nice unit, place my phone on the pad, it charges, simple as that.

**iMac**, I've been pining for a retina screen for a while, the screen on this is beautiful! I've gone for the *4GHz i7* with *16GB RAM*.

**MacBook Pro**, this has been my primary machine since I bought it 21 months ago. *2.5GHz i5* with *8GB RAM*.

**iPad 4**, I don't really use the iPad that much day to day, but it's the perfect device for traveling.

### Obligatory Timelapse

It's three and a half minutes long, but here you can see the progression from clearing my room out, transferring files, filling in the cut out on my desk, covering the desk in vinyl, and finally setting up my new iMac.
